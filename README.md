## General Information
Build a model to automaticall classify customer complaints ticket
-Predict Whether high value customers will churn or not
Classification should fall into major categories
-Credit card / Prepaid card
-Bank account services
-Theft/Dispute reporting
-Mortgages/loans
-Others 


## Objective
Build a  NLP model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue

## Approach
Steps followed in the data analysis
- Data loading
-Text preprocessing
-Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Feature extraction
-Topic modelling 
-Model building using supervised learning
  -Logistic Regression
  -Decision Tree
  -Random Classifier
-Model training and evaluation
-Model inferenceLoad the data
-Plan is to build multiple models 
  
 
## Conclusions
Relevant Python notebook and embeded output is part of the github repo

## Technologies Used
- Google collab
- Jupiter Notebook
- Programming : Python 3.x
